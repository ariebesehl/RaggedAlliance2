# Ragged Alliance 2
An ARMA 3 mission inspired by a very similar sounding game.

Liberate cities, villages and other locations on the islands of Tanoa. Player starting inventory, loot inventory and enemy inventory is random and improves with game progress. At the start, you'll be facing looters with no body armor armed with pistols, SMGs and shotguns, until you encounter the Tanoan National Army, who'll come equipped with assault rifles and machine guns.


## Instructions
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/ariebesehl/RaggedAlliance2/releases). Does **not** work on single-player, functional on self-hosted multiplayer with slightly limited gaming experience (as e.g. locations are marked on map, since they are local to your machine), designed for and works best on dedicated servers.


## Known Issues
~~Spawning in the first time is a bit buggy.~~ May have been fixed.
